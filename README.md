# My AI App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) that integrates AI capabilities using the OpenAI API.

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered chat application built with Next.js and the OpenAI API. It demonstrates how to create a simple chat interface that interacts with AI models, specifically using the GPT-4 model.

Key features:

- Real-time chat interface
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 model
- Server-side streaming of AI responses
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Getting Started

First, set up your environment:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env.local` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
